### Data coverage
As we are at the end of the course, we will give you the full data set. Because the lecture theme for the week is multi-dimensional vis we encourage you to use different encodings and filters to work with the data to try and show many dimensions. This is a wide and short data set. Part of your task this week is to decide what dimensions to use and how to show them.
