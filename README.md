# Data Visualization Portfolio
A collection of weekly visualizations showcasing data stories through Excel, DataWrapper, Tableau and more.

## 📊 About
This repository is a showcase of data visualization projects, with each one exploring a new dataset to create five visualizations that demonstrate data exploration, analysis, and visual storytelling. These projects reflect my growing experience with different visualization tools and design principles.

## 🛠 Tools & Platforms  
- **Tableau**      – interactive dashboards and visual analysis  
- **Excel**        – data cleaning, quick visuals, and summaries  
- **Datawrapper**  – publication-ready, clean visualizations  
- **Observable**   – web-based interactive graphics

## 🔍 Key Takeaways
- Clear, easy-to-understand visualizations that reveal patterns and outliers in the data.  
- Exploration of datasets using multiple tools and platforms.  
- Insights presented in a way that supports decision-making.  
- Variety of charts and dashboards to answer different questions about the data.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder contains:  
- 📁 **Dataset** and links to its source  
- 🧩 **Visualization files** (Tableau workbook, Excel file, Datawrapper chart, or Observable notebook)  
- 🖼 **Final visuals** (images, dashboards, or charts)  
- 📝 **Short summary** of insights and observations

## 🚀 Future Plans
I plan to continue adding weekly projects, experimenting with interactive visualizations, and exploring new tools and techniques to enhance storytelling with data.
