# Data Theme: Natural World

## Data Background
### Topic
The topic for the data is Alberta breeding pairs of 
[Canada’s National Bird](https://canadiangeographic.ca/articles/meet-our-national-bird-the-gray-jay/) and runners up.

### Visualization context
This directory's dataset was inspired by [Jer Thorp](https://www.jerthorp.me/learning). Jer is a very 
well-known data visualization designer and data artist. His work is worth looking at for inspiration in relation to 
design. The theme of visualizing bird data crops up elsewhere as well such as in the 
[Project Data Sense](https://project-data-sense.com/seeing-bird-songs) which focuses on seeing bird song.

### Background context
In the mid 2010’s Canada went through the process of 
[selecting a national bird](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/national-bird-canadian-geographic-1.3768758). There 
were five different birds on the short list and in the end the [Gray Jay](https://canadiangeographic.ca/articles/meet-our-national-bird-the-gray-jay/) 
was selected as our national bird. Your data set includes data about the breeding pairs of the five species on the short 
list. One aspect of bird health is the ongoing nesting and breeding of the species. The data set provided focuses on this 
aspect of bird behaviour.

## About
### This Directory's Data
A filtered version of the data set is linked below. You are strongly encouraged to further filter the data to an aspect 
of interest so that you can hone in on one aspect to make you story. 

### Data set attribution
This data is downloaded through the site [Nature Counts](https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/main.jsp). And we have 
combined two data sets:

- Nature Alberta. 2025. "Alberta Breeding Bird Atlas (2000-2005)". Data accessed from NatureCounts, Birds Canada. 10.71842/m53n-bs25
- Federation of Alberta Naturalists. 2025. "Alberta Breeding Bird Atlas (1987-1992)". Data accessed from NatureCounts, Birds Canada. 10.71842/gngp-jv60

## How it was collected
Several different observers (there is a field for this) contribute to the data and recorded observations.

### Where it covers
Its geographic coverage is Alberta.

### Time range
Its time range includes a period the late 1980’s and early 1990’s and a second period in the early 2000’s.

### Data coverage
For scale, it has been filtered to only the shortlisted species from when Canada chose its national bird. The full data 
set is observations of a much larger number of bird species.

### Other Context
There are some more obscure values in the data set, such as the observation type which can be clarified by looking 
[here](https://www.mba-aom.ca/jsp/codes.jsp?lang=en&pg=breeding) and [here](https://naturecounts.ca/norac/atlascodes.htm). 
We have also removed a range of values related to scientific names to reduce the overall amount of data you have to sift through.
