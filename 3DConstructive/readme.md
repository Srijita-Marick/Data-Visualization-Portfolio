# Data Theme: Transport

## About
The data set for this directory comes from The City of Calgary Open Data Portal and is drawn from the data set 
[Bike and Pedestrian Counts](https://data.calgary.ca/Transportation-Transit/Bike-and-Pedestrian-Counts/pede-tz7g/about_data) 
which gives a sensor count of bike riders at several locations. We have included four locations in this data set. 

The values in the data set are groups of 40,000 cyclists. The csv file contains the count of cyclists at select sensor 
locations from 2018-2024.
